# obs-studio-25.0.1-built-win-x64
 contents of obs-studio\build\rundir\Debug\
Build from March 20th 2020 of the win x64 obs-studio. I guess this is a portable version since you would not need to use the installer. Total size reads 194 MB (204,425,186 bytes) omitting the hidden .git directory. From start (no repo downloaded, no libraries configured) to finish this took about 1 hour., following the instructions here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/Install-Instructions#windows-build-directions . For the qt5.10.1 dependency I used this link here: https://github.com/martinrotter/qt5-minimalistic-builds/releases ... I think in cmake-gui it was necessary to set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to the qt directory as well as to set the other environment variables listed in the instructions.
